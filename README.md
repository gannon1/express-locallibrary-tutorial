This project had many learning objectives. The first was to understand how databases can work with a website to create an application so that you can view and store data. The second objective was to learn how each part of the project worked, such as the controllers or views. Another objective was to learn how to deploy a completed app to production. 

I had a few challenges while working on this project. I initially had issues understanding how pug code is written using spaces and indentions. This caused a few of my delete files to not work properly as my lines were not indented the right way. I fixed this by studying sections of pug code and learning how do use spaces and indentation properly.

The things I learned form this tutorial can be applied in many ways. Understanding how controllers work will help with just about any web application. Also any app that you create needs to be deployed when finished so learning that process is useful. This tutorial will be quite useful for furture web projects.
